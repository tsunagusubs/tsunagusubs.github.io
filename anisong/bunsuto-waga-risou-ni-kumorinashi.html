    "Come, it's time for work."
    There'll be no confusion and the like if everything goes as planned
    just accomplishing what had been decided on

    Come, shall we work hard again today?

    Ah, as the countdown in the business of investigations, interrogations, and stakeouts ticks

    those guys haven't taken in anything unexpected, perfect!


    How shall I live through the present compared to the past?

    If I think it over thoroughly, simple as that

    then I'll find both my ideal and answer right here within


    I run forward only so

    my wishes won't waver

    No clouds are blotting out my ideal

    I'll teach you...this page of mine!


    Jokes are a waste of time and teasing is absurd

    ...just try and say it makes you feel good every time you open your mouth!


    Thinking deeply because I can't approve of

    ending up only pushing away the parts that confuse you

    My ideal exists to be realized


    If there's somewhat of a fighting scene

    Well, that's to be expected, unfortunately

    I move forward as I scold my colleagues for being too cocky


    "What I write in my notebook is the future"

    Certainly if I believe I will reach that point(Is that really true?)


    I'm the kind of man that will never give in no matter how many times I find myself in a dillema

    I suppose the unexpected variable they call "authority" is the number one thing I despise in this society


    There's no meaning in simply adopting an ideal

    I'll just start speaking through my actions

    Come, we're due for a match now as usual

    Let's end it in the time we have to hypothesize
    <br>

    I only run forward so I won't waver

    no matter what kind of days we go through

    No clouds are blotting out my ideal

    I'll teach you...this page of mine!
